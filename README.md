Sign Language Translator
📌 Overview

Sign Language Translator is a multilingual web-based application that converts written text into corresponding sign language images. The project aims to improve accessibility and communication for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals by providing a simple, visual representation of sign language.

The application supports English and multiple Indian regional languages. Text input is translated (if required) and then mapped to sign language images at the alphabet or word level.

This project is developed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) suitable for hackathons, academic projects, and awareness initiatives.
